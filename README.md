## Overview ##

There are two main types of users in Keops: **Users** (also known as "Evaluators") and **Admins**.
Admins can perform management tasks (such as creating tasks, uploading corpora to evaluate, invite users...) and evaluation tasks,
while regular Users can only perform evaluation tasks (assigned by the Admins).

<a name="admins"></a>

### Admins ###
The most common **workflow** for an **Admin** is as follows: 

First, the Admin **invites** the evaluators to Keops, if they are not Keops users yet. For this, the Admin just needs their emails, and give them the **invitation token** generated by Keops.
The invitation token, together with the user email, is what an user needs to create its account.

Then the admin **uploads** one (or more) parallel **corpus**, indicating the source and target languages (most common EU languages are pre-loaded, but Admins can add new ones beforehand, if needed).

After these two first steps, the Admin creates a new **Project**, indicating its source and target languages.

<img src="screenshots/management-page.png" width="700" />


When the project is created, the Admin can create **Tasks** in the Project. 
For this, the Admin just needs to indicate who is the **evaluator** and the **corpus** to be evaluated. 
Please note that only users and corpora matching the project languages will be available for choosing.

<img src="screenshots/tasks-project-page.png" width="700">


Once the task is created, Evaluators can immediately start working on them.
When an Evaluator finishes evaluating all sentences from a task, and markes it as **DONE**, the Admin is able to **download** the stats of the evaluation (a CSV file containing the amount of sentences per evaluation label) and the annotated corpus (a TSV file containing the parallel sentences and their evaluations).

### Evaluators ###

The common **workflow** for an **Evaluator** is simpler:

After getting an **invitation** (an invitation token, together with the evaluator's email), the Evaluator **signs up** and creates an account.
It's important that Evaluators include their languages, so Admins can assign tasks to them. 

<img src="screenshots/signup-page.png" width="700">


If the Evaluator already had an account in Keops, instead of signing up, the Evaluator just needs to **sign in**.

<img src="screenshots/guide/login.png" width="700">

Once logged in, in their Keops **homepage**, Evaluators can see a list of **tasks** they are assigned to.  
Evaluators just need to click the **start/continue** button of the desired task, and then start evaluating.

<img src="screenshots/tasks-page.png" width="700">

In the **evaluation** page,  two sentences are displayed (source above and target below).
The evaluator has to **annotate** the parallel sentence, this is, choose the **label** that fits the most (Wrong language, MT translation...) in case of error, or mark it as valid is the parallel sentence is correct.
**Validation guidelines** are also available at any time to help the Evaluator to choose the right option. 
Evaluators are also allowed to add a **comment** to each parallel sentence, in order to clarify their annotations.

<img src="screenshots/evaluation-page.png" width="700">


Once all sentences of a task are evaluated, the Evaluator is redirected to the **recap** page for the task, where the evaluation stats of the task are shown. 
By marking the task as **DONE**, the Evaluator states that the task is finished, and from that moment, the Admin is able to **download** the stats of the evaluation and the evaluated sentences.

## DB Schema ##

![DB Schema](keops.png)

A project can have several tasks (see table "tasks"), each one consisting of several sentences (see table "sentences_tasks"). 

Sentences belong to a corpus (see table "corpora" and "sentences"), but can be used in several  tasks (see table "sentences_tasks")

A task can only have one user assigned to it (see table "tasks"), but one user can have several tasks assignated.

An user (admin or evaluator) can have to several languages associated (see table "user_langs"). 

An admin can have several projects (see table "projects"), but each project has only one administrator (owner).

## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions ##

<a name="faq-corpora"></a>

### Which format must corpora have to be properly uploaded to Keops? ###

Corpora is always uploaded in TSV format. This format uses one line per record and a tab character to separate fields.

The specific format of the TSV file is explained below for each of the evaluation modes. This information is alsa available on KEOPS clicking on _First time uploading corpora_. You can also download a template and use it to upload your data:

* [Validation template](/corpora/templates/validation.tsv)
* [Adequacy template](/corpora/templates/adequacy.tsv)
* [Fluency template](/corpora/templates/fluency.tsv)
* [Ranking template](/corpora/templates/ranking.tsv)

#### Corpora for validation
| Source text | Tab | Target text |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You can contact our customer service department using the form below | Tab | Puedes ponerte en contacto con nuestro departamento de servicio al cliente mediante el siguiente formulario |

You should only include one target text for each source text.

#### Corpora for adequacy
| Source text | Tab | Candidate translation |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You can contact our customer service department using the form below | Tab | Puedes ponerte en contacto con nuestro departamento de servicio al cliente mediante el siguiente formulario |

You should only include one candidate translation for each source text.

<a name="faq-langs"></a>

### Which languages are preloaded in Keops? ###
 
Preloaded languages are:  Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Danish (da),  German (de), Greek (el), English (en), Spanish (es), Estonian (et), Finnish (fi), French (fr),  
Irish (ga), Croatian (hr), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Lithuanian (lt), Latvian (lv), Maltese (mt), Norwegian - bokmal (no), Norwegian - nynorsk (nn), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl),  Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), 
Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl) and Swedish (sv).

But remember: Admins can add as many languages as needed, at any time!

<a name="guidelines"></a>

### What are "validation guidelines"? ###

Evaluators working with Keops must follow the European Language Resource Coordination (ELRC) validation guidelines.

To ensure consistency from one evaluator to another, the following system has been adopted for grading translations.
Evaluators should use the following types/labels to tag problematic cases:

 
  * Wrong language identification 
  * Incorrect alignment
  * Wrong tokenization
  * MT translation
  * Translation error
  * Free translation
 

For more information on each label, please check the [ELRC Validation Guidelines document](http://www.lr-coordination.eu/sites/default/files/common/ELRC%20Data%20Validation%20Guidelines.pdf), section "4.2.2.2  Validation by human experts".

Remember: Evaluators can refer to the Validation Guidelines at any time, just clicking in the link in the Evaluation window.

<a name="summary-format"></a>

### Which format does the "task summary" file have? ###

The Task Summary (or task stats) file is a TSV file containing a summary of the task once it is finished. The format will change depending on the type of the task.

#### Validation
Each line contains the Label code, the Label description and the amount of entries tagged with that label in the task. For example:

```
Label 	Description           Count
L     	Wrong language id. 	  44
A     	Incorrect alignment   150
T     	Wrong tokenization    204
